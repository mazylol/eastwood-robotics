# Eastwood Robotics Website
This site was built for the 2023 Best Robotics Competition

## Technical Details
- **Framework**:  [Astro](https://astro.build)
- **Integrations**
    - [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com)
    - [React](https://react.dev)

Most of the website is made with raw astro, which is basically just html with some conveniences. The entirety of the team page is react due to the unforunate complexity of it.

## Running
If for some reason you would like to mess around with the website:
```sh
(npm/pnpm/yarn) run dev
```
